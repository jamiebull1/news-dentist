A tool for extracting the text of articles on Google News and saving
it to a text file.

This tool requires `libxml2` and `libxslt`. The easiest way to 
install these is to install `minconda`, create and activate a new
virtual environment, then run `conda install lxml`. You can
then run `python setup.py install` as normal.
